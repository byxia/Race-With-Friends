Race with Friends


What it is:
A mobile app that allows you to run physical races against your Facebook friends, whenever and wherever. The races can be asynchronous as well as in different physical locations (in which case of course both runs will be the same length).

What it does:
- Link with Facebook
- Challenge a friend to a race and record race track live
- See a list of races that you are involved with
- See details of a race (people, distance, status, race times, winner)
- Playback animation of a race both when it's incomplete and complete (incomplete will show only 1 player's tracks)
- Accept a race challenge and complete that race
- Cancel a race that's started by yourself
- See anyone's profile page with stats (total wins, distance, time) and personal records

Design Process:
